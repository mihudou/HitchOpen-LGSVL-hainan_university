#6.2.3	Appendix B3 â€“ Vehicle Path Trajectory Update (VPTU) Message
#Each cycle the RPC will pass 6 variables to the RVC.  The RPC will determine the desired TTL, Waypoint Index, Target speed, TTL transition state, Target Transition distance, and Trajectory Line Optimizer flag. The variable names and structure are as follows.
#a.	Current_TTL_Index (Int32, index of the desired TTL within the TTL_Init_Array)
#b.	Waypoint_Index (Int32, (Index of the waypoint the Ego in currently at within the current TTL)
#c.	Target_Speed (float64, speed controlled based on table below)#
#		Value	Code Logic
#       0		Drive to TTL WP Target Speed (index 14) unless RLO_Flag is true
#		>0	Drive to the given value of Target_Speed = n
#d.	WaylineDelta (float64, desired distance from waypoint

#index of the desired TTL within the TTL_Init_Array
